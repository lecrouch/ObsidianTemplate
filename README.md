# How to use this repo:
1. Download and install [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/)
2. Download the most current version of `MyDigitalBrain_Vxx.zip` from this repo, **OR** just clone the repo if you'd rather (advanced option).
3. Unzip the contents of the file wherever you'd like to have your 'Obsidian Vault' (what Obsidian calls your note folder where *everything* is saved.
    - Since I'm part of Apple the ecosystem I put it in my iCloud folder so that all of my devices use the *same* Vault.
4. Open obsidian and point it the Vault you just decompressed (`MyDigitalBrain`)
5. When prompted about Safe Mode: **Turn Safe Mode *off***
6. Locate the `__README` note within the Vault, it explains *everything*
7. **FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, PLZ DO #5**
8. *Play*
9. ...
10. If you have suggestions for how to made this thing better, let me know and I can update the repo!  Alternatively if you're a total nerd, create your own vault template (just a fresh vault with everything wired up, like this one) zip it, and submit a PR here!

#### Enjoy! <3

### P.S.  I'll record a video and link it later...

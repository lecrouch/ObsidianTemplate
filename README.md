# My current Obsidian Template
---

# How to use:
1. Download and install [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/)
2. Download the `DigitalBrainTemplate.zip` from this repo
3. Unzip the contents of the file wherever you'd like to have your 'Obsidian Vault' (what Obsidian calls your note folder where *everything* is saved.
    - Since I'm part of the ecosystem I put it in my iCloud folder so that all of my devices use the *same* Vault.
5. Open obsidian and point it the Vault you just decompressed (`DigitalBrainTemplate`)
6. Locate the `__README` note within the Vault, it explains *everything*
7. **FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, PLZ DO #6**
8. *Play*
9. ...
10. If you have suggestions for how to made this thing better, let me know and I can update the repo!  Alternatively if you're a total nerd, create your own vault template (just a fresh vault with everything wired up, like this one) zip it, and submit a PR here!



#### Enjoy! <3

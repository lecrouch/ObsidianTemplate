## This system utilizes *nested* tags
### i.e. 游닌/游닄/游린
##### How it works:
- 游닌  **Inbox** (An item to come back to)
	- 游눬 **Thought**
	- 游닄 **Book**
	- 游닆 **Article**
	- 游꿏 **Podcast**
	- 游꿘  **Video**
		- 游린  Not Processed
		- 游릳  Processing
		- 游릴  Complete

#### So, in practice, you can read 游닌/游닄/游린  as:
"A book note that you've *just* started or *plan to start*."

### It's probably worth mentioning that
游닌/游닄/游릴  technically shouldn't "exist" since once a thing is complete, that's your signal to remove the note from your *Inbox* and put it somewhere else, like the *Books* folder. (`CMD+P` > File Explorer: Move to another folder.)

### Finding Notes later on:
##### If looking for complete book notes:
You could do a search for `tag:#游닄/游릴`
##### Alternatives, if searching for all books in your inbox:
You could do a search for `tag:#游닌/游닄`
##### Or all new books in your inbox:
You could do a search for `tag:#游닌/游닄/游린`
##### etc, you get the idea.
